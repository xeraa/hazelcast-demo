# Hazelcast Demo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xeraa/hazelcast-demo.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xeraa/hazelcast-demo)

This is a simple test project I used to show some of [Hazelcast's](http://www.hazelcast.org) features.


## Requirements
*   JDK7+
*   Maven2+ (tested with Maven2 and Maven3)

An IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ is highly recommended but not required.


## Getting started
Inside the base folder (where the pom.xml file is located) run the following commands to get started:

    mvn install
    mvn test
